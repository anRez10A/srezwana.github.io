Welcome to my portfolio. As an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET), I am passionate about contributing to both research and teaching. My thesis work and academic background are rooted in Machine Learning, AI and Deep Learning, which has shaped my interest in exploring its applications in Signal Processing, Image Processing and NLP. Alongside a strong foundation in those particular fields, I am eager to apply my technical expertise and analytical skills to address emerging challenges in cybersecurity, cyber-physical systems and computer vision. Currently preparing for PhD admission, I am actively seeking research opportunities to advance cutting-edge developments in secure and intelligent systems.

## Publications

### Research Papers
1. **S. Rezwana** and M. F. Ahamed, “**Comprehensive Analysis of Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning Techniques for Multilingual and Noisy Environments**,” submitted to the *2025 IEEE International Conference On Sustainable Technologies For Industry 5.0 (STI 2025)*. **(accepted)**

### Bachelor’s Thesis
**Topic:** *Comprehensive Analysis of Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning Techniques for Multilingual and Noisy Environments*  
**Thesis Supervisor:** Md. Faysal Ahmed, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ECE, RUET.  
**Contribution:**
- ✅ Residual 2D CNN with Bayesian optimization gave faster convergence and real-time inference.
- ✅ Use of transfer learning with augmentation boosted performance across accents and conditions.
- ✅ Pitch shifting, time stretching, and noise injection improved robustness; class weighting handled imbalance.

### Work in Progress
- ✅ Improve the robustness of Multi-modal Emotion Recognition in real time.
- ✅ Developed a dataset of 20,000 samples for emotion recognition in Bangla text, categorized into 6 emotions. Applied LLM-based NLP techniques to analyze and classify emotional content, contributing to research in natural language processing for the Bengali language.
